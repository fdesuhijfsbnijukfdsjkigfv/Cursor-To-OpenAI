# Cursor To OpenAI

Convert the Cursor editor into an OpenAI-compatible API service.

## Project Overview

This project provides a proxy service that transforms the AI capabilities of the Cursor editor into an OpenAI-compatible API, allowing you to reuse Cursor's AI features in other applications.
- Supports multiple cookies at the same time, separated by commas.

## Prerequisites

1. Visit [www.cursor.com](https://www.cursor.com) and complete the registration and login process (you get 150 free quick responses, which can be reset by deleting your account and re-registering).
2. Open the developer tools in your browser (F12).
3. Locate the `WorkosCursorSessionToken` value in **Application â†’ Cookies** and save it (this is equivalent to an OpenAI API key).
